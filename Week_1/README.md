# Week 1 Labs: Testing, Types, and Mapping

## Objective
To introduce Python basics by practicing variable assignment, data types, and mapping structures (dictionaries).

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Sypder

## Testing Variables

### Step‑by‑Step Process
1. Created a variable `firstname`.  
2. Printed the variable to confirm output.  

### Commands Executed
```python
firstname = "Natalie"
print(firstname)
```

### Key Observations / Lessons Learned
- Variables store data values.
- Strings are always in quotation marks.  
- `print()` displays the stored value.  

---

## Data Types

### Step‑by‑Step Process
1. Assigned integer, float, and complex numbers.  
2. Checked their types using `type()`.  
3. Created list, tuple, and range objects.  
4. Verified their types.  

### Commands Executed
```python
x = 8
y = 3.14159265
z = 1 - 2j
print(type(x))
print(type(y))
print(type(z))

mylist = [5,10,15,20,25]
mytuple = (7,14,21,28,35)
myrange = range(5,35)
print(type(mylist))
print(type(mytuple))
print(type(myrange))
```

### Key Observations / Lessons Learned
- Python supports multiple data types: integers, floats, complex numbers.  
- Collections include lists (mutable), tuples (immutable), and ranges (sequences).  
- `type()` is useful for verifying object types.

## Lab 3: Mapping with Dictionaries

### Step‑by‑Step Process
1. Created a dictionary with key‑value pairs.  
2. Accessed values using keys.  
3. Printed the dictionary.  

### Commands Executed
```python
PyroCyber = {
    "Name":"Bill",
    "Age":98,
    "Sport":"Volleyball",
    "Food":"Broccoli",
    "Favourite color":"Green"
}
PyroCyber["Name"]
print(PyroCyber)
```
### Screenshot of Results

### Key Observations / Lessons Learned
- Dictionaries store data as **unordered key‑value pairs**.  
- Keys are unique identifiers; values can be any data type.  
- Accessing values by key is straightforward.  

---

## Overall Reflection
- Learned how to assign and print variables.  
- Explored Python’s fundamental data types.  
- Practiced dictionary creation and access. `hkj`
